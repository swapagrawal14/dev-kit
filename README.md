## 💡 The "OneFile" Philosophy

This project was built as a creative challenge: to pack as much utility and aesthetic appeal as possible into a single, dependency-free file. It demonstrates the power of modern web technologies.

*   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the application.
*   **CSS3:** For the stunning visuals, including the aurora background, glassmorphism, and responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the application logic, from UI interactions to the functionality of each individual tool. No frameworks, no libraries, just pure browser power.
